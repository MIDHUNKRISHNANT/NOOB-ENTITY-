Random Forest : Random forest, like its name implies, consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble.
Each individual tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction and the class with the 
most votes becomes our model’s prediction (see figure below).

The fundamental concept behind random forest is a simple but powerful one — the wisdom of crowds. In data science speak,
the reason that the random forest model works so well is:
>A large number of relatively uncorrelated models (trees) operating as a committee will outperform any of the individual constituent models.
